# My Academic job application materials &mdash; Fall 2023

Here lie the documents I wrote and prepared for my academic job applications during Fall 2023. Are these good examples? We'll know by April 2024 if I get a job based on these &mdash; but everyone's tired advice to ```#network``` is hilariously true in academia. You'll get a job mostly based on who you know, who knows you, *how* they know you, and what you've done (your CV). 

There are 4 documents in this repository:

- **Cover Letter**
- **Research Statement**: Writing in terms of themes of your research until now, and themes moving forward helped me draft this statement.
- **Teaching Statement**: Useful if applying to liberal arts schools in the US. Most research schools might not even read this, so if you're only applying to those don't sweat it. Unless you actually care about and enjoy teaching, which I did.
- **Diversity Statement**: I find it helps to be *concrete* in terms of real-life examples of how you have helped diversify your teaching/research, and how you will moving forward. 

Some disclaimers and what you can do with these:
- I applied (mostly) to **Linguistic and Computer Science departments in the USA**. 
- Feel free to steal any *ideas* in content or style from these statements. I hope they help you.
- All the LaTeX templates are up on [my ```texmf``` repository]() &mdash; steal what you like, or use them wholesale.
