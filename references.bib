    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

    abstract = "Reading comprehension QA tasks have seen a recent surge in popularity, yet most works have focused on fact-finding extractive QA. We instead focus on a more challenging multi-hop generative task (NarrativeQA), which requires the model to reason, gather, and synthesize disjoint pieces of information within the context to generate an answer. This type of multi-step reasoning also often requires understanding implicit relations, which humans resolve via external, background commonsense knowledge. We first present a strong generative baseline that uses a multi-attention mechanism to perform multiple hops of reasoning and a pointer-generator decoder to synthesize the answer. This model performs substantially better than previous generative models, and is competitive with current state-of-the-art span prediction models. We next introduce a novel system for selecting grounded multi-hop relational commonsense information from ConceptNet via a pointwise mutual information and term-frequency based scoring function. Finally, we effectively use this extracted commonsense information to fill in gaps of reasoning between context hops, using a selectively-gated attention mechanism. This boosts the model{'}s performance significantly (also verified via human evaluation), establishing a new state-of-the-art for the task. We also show that our background knowledge enhancements are generalizable and improve performance on QAngaroo-WikiHop, another multi-hop reasoning dataset.",

During training, LMs have access only to text of these documents, with no direct evidence of the internal states of the agents that produced them{---}a fact often used to argue that LMs are incapable of modeling goal-directed aspects of human language production and comprehension. Can LMs trained on text learn anything at all about the relationship between language and use? I argue that LMs are models of communicative intentions in a specific, narrow sense. When performing next word prediction given a textual context, an LM can infer and represent properties of an agent likely to have produced that context. These representations can in turn influence subsequent LM generation in the same way that agents{'} communicative intentions influence their language. I survey findings from the recent literature showing that{---}even in today{'}s non-robust and error-prone models{---}LMs infer and use representations of fine-grained communicative intentions and high-level beliefs and goals. Despite the limited nature of their training data, they can thus serve as building blocks for systems that communicate and act intentionally.",

It is an important characteristic of speaker intention and language style, and is useful in {NLP} applications such as summarization and argumentation mining. Yet to date, expert-annotated data for sentence-level specificity are scarce and confined to the news genre. In addition, systems that predict sentence specificity are classifiers trained to produce binary labels (general or specific).We collect a dataset of over 7,000 tweets annotated with specificity on a fine-grained scale. Using this dataset, we train a supervised regression model that accurately estimates specificity in social media posts, reaching a mean absolute error of 0.3578 (for ratings on a scale of 1-5) and 0.73 Pearson correlation, significantly improving over baselines and previous sentence specificity prediction systems. We also present the first large-scale study revealing the social, temporal and mental health factors underlying language specificity on social media.},

Language also constitutes the principal means by which sociologists and social-psychologists tend to measure stereotypes. Language abstraction plays a subtle but important role in stereotype transmission and maintenance. The aim of this chapter is to describe language abstraction and its development over the past years. The chapter discusses its implications and proposes extensions of the model to related areas. The linguistic intergroup bias ({LIB}) model describes a systematic bias in language use, which can contribute to the perpetuation of stereotypes. The chapter describes the research paradigm most frequently employed in {LIB} studies, reviews empirical findings testing the main predictions, addresses questions of external validity, compares hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of the {LIB}, speculate about extensions of the model beyond intergroup relations, and finally discusses a number of open problems that are of interest.},

Empirical results show that today{'}s models struggle at TuringAdvice, even multibillion parameter models finetuned on 600k in-domain training examples. The best model, T5, writes advice that is at least as helpful as human-written advice in only 14{\%} of cases; a much larger non-finetunable GPT3 model does even worse at 4{\%}.

In this work we extrapolate to a broader notion of bias, rooted in social science and psychology literature. We move towards predicting interpersonal group relationship (IGR) - modeling the relationship between the speaker and the target in an utterance - using fine-grained interpersonal emotions as an anchor. We build and release a dataset of English tweets by US Congress members annotated for interpersonal emotion - the first of its kind, and {`}found supervision{'} for IGR labels; our analyses show that subtle emotional signals are indicative of different biases. While humans can perform better than chance at identifying IGR given an utterance, we show that neural models perform much better; furthermore, a shared encoding between IGR and interpersonal perceived emotion enabled performance gains in both tasks.",
